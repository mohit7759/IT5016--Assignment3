# Turtle Circle Pattern Drawing
## Overview
This Python script uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a circle pattern. The script creates a turtle object and draws multiple circles of different colors to create an intricate pattern.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Copy the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., circle_pattern.py).
Run the Python script using a Python interpreter.
The Turtle graphics window will display the circle pattern.
## Files Included

- colorfulcirclepattern.py: The Python script containing the code to draw the circle pattern.
- README.md: This file, providing information about the circle pattern drawing script.

## Requirements
Python 3.11
Turtle graphics library (included in the Python standard library)

## let's analyze the programming principles and concepts demonstrated in the provided code:

-Turtle Graphics: The code utilizes the Turtle graphics library, which provides a simple way to create graphics using a turtle metaphor. The turtle moves around the screen drawing lines, shapes, and patterns.

-Loops: The for loop is used to repeat the drawing of circles. It iterates 36 times to draw a total of 36 circles in the pattern.

-Color Cycling: The code demonstrates how to cycle through a list of colors to apply different colors to each circle drawn. This concept can be useful for creating colorful and visually appealing graphics.

-Procedure-Oriented Programming: The code follows a procedural programming paradigm, where actions are performed sequentially in a series of steps. Each step involves calling predefined functions ***(e.g., pensize(), pencolor(), circle(), right())***.

-Rotation: The right() method is used to rotate the turtle by a specified angle ***(in this case, 10 degrees)*** after drawing each circle. This rotation creates the spiral effect in the circle pattern.

-Repetition and Patterns: The code demonstrates how repetition (looping) can be used to create intricate patterns. By combining simple shapes (circles) and repetitive actions, complex and visually interesting patterns can be generated.
