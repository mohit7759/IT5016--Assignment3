# Programming principles and concepts demonstrated in the provided code snippets:

## Variables and Data Types: 
- The code uses variables to store data such as numbers, strings, and boolean values. This demonstrates the concept of variables and different data types in Python.

## Control Flow:

- If Statements: The code uses if, elif, and else statements to conditionally execute blocks of code based on certain conditions. This demonstrates the concept of control flow and decision-making in programming.
- Loops: The code utilizes for and while loops to iterate over sequences and perform repetitive tasks. This demonstrates the concept of iteration and looping in programming.
- Break and Continue Statements: The code uses break and continue statements within loops to control the flow of the loop execution. break is used to terminate the loop prematurely, while continue is used to skip the rest of the loop's code for the current iteration.

## Functions:
- The code defines functions using the def keyword, encapsulating reusable blocks of code. This demonstrates the concept of functions and modular programming.
- The functions accept parameters (inputs) and may return values as outputs. This demonstrates the concept of function arguments and return values.
- The functions also include docstrings to provide documentation about their purpose and usage. This demonstrates the concept of code documentation and readability.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- The code defines classes (Cat, DomesticCat, WildCat) to represent objects and their behaviors. This demonstrates the concept of object-oriented programming.
-The classes include attributes (variables) and methods (functions) to define the behavior and properties of the objects. This demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism - key principles of OOP.
-The code demonstrates inheritance by creating subclasses (DomesticCat, WildCat) that inherit attributes and methods from a parent class (Cat).

## Encapsulation and Access Modifiers:
The code uses access modifiers (__isHappy) to encapsulate data within classes and control access to it. This demonstrates the concept of encapsulation, where the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world.
